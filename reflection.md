I chose to use JavaScript because I am already familiar with JavaScript so I was able to quickly understand the structure of the program and know how and where to make the changes.

What modifications did you make to the script? Include details on what you changed in the code in order to achieve these modifications.

The requirements called for 6 changes: modify the size and speed of the ball, the height and width of the canvas, and the speed of both the ai and player paddles.
To change the ball size, the ball.side variable was changed from 15 to 12 (making the ball 9 pixels smaller).
To change the ball speed, the ball.speed variable was changed from 9 to 12 (making the ball a little bit faster)
To change the height and width of the canvas the HEIGHT contsant was changed from 600 to 500 and the WIDTH constant was changed from 700 to 800 - this resulted in a canvas that was more rectangular than the original.
To change the speed of the ai paddle, the the multiplier on line 80 was changed from 0.1 to 0.075, making the ai paddle move slightly slower than the original (making it a little easier for player to win).
To change the speed of the player paddle, *NEED TO MAKE THIS CHANGE*

Did you make any advanced modifications? If yes, include details on what you changed in the code in order to achieve these modifications. If no, describe why you chose not to make any advanced modifications.
